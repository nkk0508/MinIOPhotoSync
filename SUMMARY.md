# MinIO Photo Sync - Project Summary

## Overview

MinIO Photo Sync is an iOS application that allows users to synchronize photos between their iOS device and a MinIO server. The app efficiently syncs only photos that have changed since the last synchronization by comparing checksums and modification dates.

## Key Features

1. **Photo Library Integration**
   - Access and display photos from the device's photo library
   - Request necessary permissions for photo access

2. **Efficient Synchronization**
   - Calculate checksums for photos to identify changes
   - Sync only photos that are new or have been modified
   - Track sync status for each photo

3. **MinIO Server Integration**
   - Secure authentication using AWS Signature V4
   - List, upload, and download photos from MinIO
   - Parse XML responses from MinIO API

4. **User Interface**
   - Tabbed interface for easy navigation
   - Grid view for browsing photos
   - Detailed view for individual photos with zoom and pan
   - Settings configuration for MinIO server

5. **Error Handling**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Centralized error handling system

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Models**: Define data structures for local and MinIO photos
- **Views**: User interface components built with SwiftUI
- **ViewModels**: Business logic for photo synchronization
- **Services**: Communication with MinIO server

## Implementation Details

### Photo Synchronization Logic

The app uses a differential synchronization approach:

1. Load photos from the device's photo library
2. Calculate SHA-256 checksums for each photo
3. Compare with photos stored on MinIO server
4. Upload only photos that are new or modified
5. Update sync status for each photo

### MinIO Integration

The app communicates with MinIO using standard HTTP requests:

- GET requests to list and download photos
- PUT requests to upload photos
- DELETE requests to remove photos

Authentication is handled using AWS Signature V4, which is required by MinIO and other S3-compatible services.

### User Interface

The app provides a clean and intuitive interface built with SwiftUI:

- Local Photos tab: Browse and select photos to sync
- MinIO Photos tab: View photos stored on MinIO server
- Settings tab: Configure MinIO server connection

## Files and Components

1. **MinIOPhotoSync.swift**: Main app entry point
2. **ContentView.swift**: Main tabbed interface
3. **PhotoDetailView.swift**: Detailed photo view with zoom and pan
4. **PhotoSyncViewModel.swift**: Business logic for photo synchronization
5. **MinIOService.swift**: Communication with MinIO server
6. **AWSV4Signature.swift**: AWS Signature V4 implementation
7. **MinIOXMLParser.swift**: Parser for MinIO XML responses
8. **ErrorHandler.swift**: Centralized error handling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run on an iOS device or simulator
4. Configure MinIO server settings in the app
5. Start syncing photos

## Future Enhancements

1. Background synchronization
2. Selective sync for specific albums or photos
3. Conflict resolution for photos modified in multiple places
4. Offline support with sync queue
5. Photo organization with folders or albums
6. Multi-account support for multiple MinIO servers
7. End-to-end encryption for enhanced security

## Conclusion

MinIO Photo Sync provides a robust solution for synchronizing photos between iOS devices and MinIO servers. The app's efficient synchronization algorithm ensures minimal data transfer while keeping photos in sync across devices.
